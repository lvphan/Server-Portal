# Server+Portal
Created a Portal Page with Server to serve HTML pages that I have created (Webpage Resume, To-Do List, and Rock, Paper, Scissors Game) while learning Node.js.

I ended up combining my other projects into singular HTML pages because I didn't know how to serve .css and .js files using Node.js. While browsing for solutions I saw comments mentioning Express but could not figure it out to implement it. Possibly something to consider implementing when I have more experience with Node.js.
